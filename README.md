# Probe-VA
Here, I will keep the LaTeX source files as well as various logs
for my Probe-VA projects.

## [Universal Grammar Summary Paper](UG_Summary/)
For half of the Probe-VA, I will read an introductory textbook on
Noam Chomsky's Theory of Universal Grammar, and summarise the
current state of the field in a paper I write.

## [Language Acquisition Experiment](Lang_Experiment/)
For the other half of the Probe-VA, I will teach one volunteer
the language [toki pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona)
via the "traditional" method --- i.e. using the toki pona
official book's lessons and flashcard software --- while the
other volunteer will be taught toki pona through pure immersion;
the experimenter may not explain any toki pona concepts or words
to the participant in any language other than toki pona.
