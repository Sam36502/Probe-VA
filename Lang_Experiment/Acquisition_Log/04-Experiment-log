\section{Experiment Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Duration:        From June 1st to June 25th, 2021.
 \item Experimenter:    Samuel Pearce
 \item Participants:    Amin Haidar (M19) and Julian Werner (M18)
\end{itemize}


\section{Experiment Rules}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The experimenter is, at no point during the experiment period,
 allowed to explain anything about Toki Pona to the participants in
 any language other than Toki Pona.
 \item The participants are not allowed to independently seek resources
 about Toki Pona. Any external resources for them are to be provided by
 the experimenter.
 \item The participants may converse with one another in a seperate language
 as long as the experimenter is not present.
 \item The participants may take notes and review them outside of
 experimentation times. The notes may be shared amongst themselves,
 but not with the experimenter, until the experiment is over.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Session 1 - June 1st}
The first session began in a text chat with the ability to send emoji
and images. The experimenter attempted to establish the basic sentence
structure with comprehensible pictographic substitution. The pictographic
elements will be replaced in this log with simple descriptions of their
contents or meaning in square brackets ([ Image ; Intended Meaning ])

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll pona li [Thumbs Up; Good] \\
 good SUB [Thumbs Up; Good] \\
 \glt ``pona'' (is) ``good''
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll ike li [Thumbs Down; Bad] \\
 bad SUB [Thumbs Down; Bad] \\
 \glt ``ike'' (is) ``bad''
\end{exe}

Which was generally perceived correctly, but neither participant
immediately understood the meaning of the subject-verb separator ``li''.
The next concepts to be introduced were ``yes/correct'' and ``no/incorrect''
to enforce the participants correct usage of phrases.

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll ala li [Red X-Shape; No/Incorrect] \\
 no SUB [Red X-Shape; No/Incorrect] \\
 \glt ``ala'' (is) ``No/Incorrect''
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll lon li [Green Checkmark; Yes/Correct] \\
 yes SUB [Green Checkmark; Yes/Correct] \\
 \glt ``lon'' is ``Yes/Correct''
\end{exe}

After the basic structure was grasped, the word for person --- a prefix
required to write names in Toki Pona --- was explained along with the
basic pronouns by using the participant's names. For this, it was
fortunate that there were at least three people present, in order to
explain the concepts of first, second, and third person.

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll mi jan. sina jan. [Face; Person] li jan \\
 1P.S be-person. 2P.S be-person. [Face; Person] SUB be-person \\
 \glt I am a person. You are a person. People are people.
\end{exe}

At this explanation, both participants independently responded with variations
on the following:

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll jan li [Face; Person] \\
 person SUB [Face; Person] \\
 \glt ``jan'' (is) ``person''
\end{exe}

To which, the experimenter could now respond with ``lon'' meaning, ``Yes'' or
``Correct''. Given the informal nature of the experiment, both participants
took the opportunity of having the basic ``thing is thing'' sentence structure
to insult one another and the experimenter by saying variations of the following:

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll jan Julian li ike. \\
 person Julian SUB be-bad \\
 \glt Julian is bad.
\end{exe}

It was around this time that correct Toki Pona spelling was explained, through
amphasized corrections. One participant used the other's name in lower case,
which the experimenter corrected by responding to it, with the corrected capital
letter emphasized. This concept was quite quickly understood.

Once we began speaking face-to-face, the experimenter explained the Toki Pona
demonstrative ``ni'' by pointing at various things and explaining what they
were using the established vocabulary. 

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll ni li ijo. \\
 this SUB be-thing \\
 \glt This is a thing.
\end{exe}

With the basic framework of these 10 words, explaining other novel concepts
through the use of images was quite easy and got both participants forming
basic sentences to describe their environment and what they were doing
quite quickly:

\begin{tabular}{ r | l }
 Toki Pona & English \\
 \hline
 li & Subject-Verb Seperator \\
 mi & I, me, my, we, us, our \\
 sina & you, your \\
 ona & he, she, it, him, her, his, hers, its \\
 pona & good, simple \\
 ike & bad, complicated \\
 lon & yes, correct, true \\
 ala & no, not, none \\
 ni & this, that \\
 ijo & thing \\
 \hline  
\end{tabular}

\hfill\break
After some basic nouns were learned through pictograms, the more complicated
concept of motion and giving/receiving things was discussed. At first the
word ``tawa'', meaning ``to move'' was explained by the experimenter getting
up and walking across the room while saying ``mi tawa.'' (``I go/walk.'').
After this, the preposition form of ``tawa'' was explained using the help
of the word ``pana'' which means ``to give''. One of the participants handed
the experimenter a book and asked what he was doing, to which the experimenter
replied:

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll sina pana e ni tawa mi. \\
 2P.S give ACC this PREP.to 1P.s \\
 \glt You are giving this to me.
\end{exe}

After a few clarifications and re-enunciations, the participants understood
the meaning. At around this point, One participant began compiling a
shared dictionary with the other participant. The final concept explained
was the opposite. That of ``kama'' meaning ``to arrive/come'' or ``to become''
and the concept of ``tan'' meaning ``from''. ``kama'' was fairly easily
explained by a pictograph of a person walking in the opposite direction
from a similar pictograph labelled ``tawa''. After that, the experimenter
attempted to strengthen the understanding by passing around the book again
and trying to explain that the book came from him:

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll mi pana e ni tawa sina. ni li kama tan mi. \\
 1P.S give ACC this PREP.to 2P.S. this SUB come PREP.from 1P.S\\
 \glt I give this to you. This came from me.
\end{exe}

Though the efforts were not fruitful, it eventually occurred to the experimenter
to use the mutual knowledge of each other's lives to cement tan's meaning:

\begin{exe}
 \ex
 \gll mi kama tan ma New Zealand\footnotemark. \\
 1P.S come PREP.from country New Zealand.\\
 \glt I come from New Zealand.
\end{exe}
\footnotetext{New Zealand would normally be referred to as ``ma Nusilan'', like all
foreign words, to conform to Toki Pona's phonetics, but it was decided to choose the
style of simply using words' native forms, to simplify referring to external subjects.}

This was immediately understood and served to make the participants sure of
their guesses as to its meaning.

This first session ended with the participants discussing their findings
together and editing their shared dictionary to reflect new knowledge.
All members then discussed (in English) the plans of when to meet and what
the scope of the experiment should be. It was suggested that they could
also learn Sitelen Pona, Toki Pona's own logographic writing system. This
was left open as an option depending on how much the participants were able
to learn in the time allotted. Both participants seem enthusiastic to
continue the experiment out of their own curiosity.


\section{Session 2 - June 6th}

Only one participant was available for this session, but it took place via a text
channel, so a record of it was preserved for both to review later. It began with
