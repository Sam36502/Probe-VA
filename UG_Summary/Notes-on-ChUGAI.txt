
 1 - The Nature of Universal Grammar (UG)

    -   The interface between the External (E) world and
	the Internal (I) world is called "The Computational System" by Chomsky

    -	I-Linguistics studies the structures of language in our thoughts and
	how speakers can create infinite sentences in their mind creatively.
	To them, the difference between "dived" and "dove" is insignificant;
	they both have the same internal semantics.
	 --> Concerned with what people *could* do.

    -	E-Linguistics studies the practical realisation of sounds and how they
	can differ. To them, the difference between "dived" and "dove" is important.
	 --> Concerned with what people *have* done.

    -	The Computational System provides the link between Phonetic Form (PF) and
	Logical Form (LF) relying on the Lexicon and Principles.

    -	Lexicon stores the properties of words.
    -	Principles dictate what structures can be used.

    -	The Questions for Linguists are:
	   I. What constitutes knowledge of language?
	  II. How is such knowledge acquired?
	 III. How is such knowledge put to use?
	(IV). What are the physical mechanisms that
	      serve as the material basis for this
	      system of knowledge and for use of
	      this knowledge?

    -	          Competence: The speaker-hearer's knowledge of his language
    -	         Performance: The actual use of language in concrete situations
    -	Pargmatic Competence: Places language in the institutional setting of its
	                      use, relating intentions and purposes to the ling-
	                      uistic means at hand

    -	Universals are principles like locality. They are part of the innate structure of
	the human mind and don't have to be learned. They can't be 'violated', but are
	simply not used in a certain context; They don't always need to be represented.

    -	Chomskyan Universals needn't occur in all languages, while
	Greenbergian Universals must.


 2 - Principles, Parameters and Language Acquisition

    -	Phrase structure can be diagrammed with a tree, brackets or rewrite rules (Think BNF)
